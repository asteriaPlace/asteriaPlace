    <details>
    <summary>       ... now what ...</summary>
    <br>look, more complicated websites are hard to make. I would need better tools and that's a lot of learning - im already trying to do other stuff right now.

        <summary>       this is kinda weird.</summary>
        <br>THIS ISN'T THE FINAL WEBSITE.
        <br>i'll replace this ~eventually~
        <br><br>you can just leave, ok?
            <details>
            <summary>       is there anything else</summary>
            <br>no. well- 
            <br>technically there's some leftover stuff in the files, but you'd have to waste your to time guess the url paths.
            <br> and there's not much there to begin with.
