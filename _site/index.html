  <p>hey. I didn’t think you’d actually look at this.</p>
<details style="padding-inline: 42%;">
<summary>       where is everything?</summary>
<br />I'm working on it rn,, or at least I will be at some point.
    <details>
    <summary>       ... now what ...</summary>
    <br />look, more complicated websites are hard to make. I would need better tools and that's a lot of learning - im already trying to do other stuff right now.
        <details name="three">
        <summary>       this is kinda weird.</summary>
        <br />THIS ISN'T THE FINAL WEBSITE.
        <br />i'll replace this ~eventually~
        <br /><br />you can just leave, ok?
            <details>
            <summary>       is there anything else</summary>
            <br />no. well- 
            <br />technically there's some leftover stuff in the files, but you'd have to waste your to time guess the url paths.
            <br /> and there's not much there to begin with.

        <br />oh- luna &lt;3, 
        <br />but if you found this you probably already knew that.
